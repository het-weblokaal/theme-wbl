 * Links vs Buttons vs Submit
 *
 * Anchors should be used for linking to pages or internal sections
 * Buttons should be used for interactions (more useful in applications)
 * A submit button (input type="submit") shoud be used for forms
 *
 * Note: because of conventions we can allow to style a link as a button
