## WPTT/webfont-loader

Downloads webfonts (like for example Google-Fonts), and hosts them locally on a WordPress site.

This improves performance (fewer requests to multiple top-level domains) and increases privacy. Since fonts get hosted locally on the site, there are no pings to a 3rd-party server to get the webfonts and therefore no tracking.
